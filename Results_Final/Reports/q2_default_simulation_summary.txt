=== Q2: DEFAULT SIMULATION SUMMARY ===

Key Assumptions:
 - Gaussian copula model for defaults.
 - Correlation (Factor-Default): 0.39.
 - EAD = Outstanding Principal.
 - Recovery Rate: 40%.
 - Amortization is deterministic.

Q2.a: Accumulated Defaults
Average accumulated defaults at end: 246.07
Max accumulated defaults at end: 486

Q2.b: Accumulated Credit Losses
Average accumulated loss at end: $3,315,834.69
Max accumulated loss at end: $7,428,331.90

Q2.c: VaR, Expected Loss, Total Value
See q2_credit_risk_stats.csv for detailed monthly data

Q2.d: Right-Way vs Wrong-Way Risk
Average Monthly Correlation (Loss vs Factor): -0.7378
Negative correlation suggests potential RIGHT-WAY risk (higher factor associated with lower losses).
