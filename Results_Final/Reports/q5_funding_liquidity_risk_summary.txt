=== Q5: FUNDING LIQUIDITY RISK SUMMARY ===

Key Assumptions:
 - Funding cost triggered if AccumLoss > 15% * DFV.
 - Cost = 8% * Excess Loss (applied monthly).
 - Discounting uses 5Y risk-free rate.

Q5.a: Expected and Worst Case Additional Funding Cost
Total Expected Additional Funding Cost (PV): $2,783,503.45
See q5_funding_liquidity.csv for monthly flow details.

Q5.b: Discussion on Derivative Purchase
 - Total Net Cost of Derivative (incl. CVA): $995,234.28
 - Total Expected Funding Cost (PV) without derivative: $2,783,503.45
 - The derivative appears cost-effective from an expected value perspective, as its net cost is lower than the expected funding costs it avoids.
 - Additionally, the derivative eliminates the tail risk of very high funding costs (represented by the 99% WC cost).
 - Recommendation: Purchase the derivative, as it provides a positive expected value and hedges against funding stress.
