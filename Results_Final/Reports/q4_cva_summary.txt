=== Q4: CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENT (CVA) SUMMARY ===

Key Assumptions:
 - Path-dependent EPE calculated for the derivative benefit leg.
 - Simplified CDS bootstrapping (Spread/LGD, ignores accrual & rate effects).
 - Counterparty Recovery Rate: 60%.
 - Discounting uses 5Y risk-free rate.

Q4.a: CVA Explanation
 - CVA represents the market price of counterparty credit risk associated with the derivative.
 - It is the expected loss due to the counterparty defaulting before fulfilling its obligations.
 - Calculated as Sum[ EPE(t) * PD(t) * LGD * DF(t) ], where EPE is Expected Positive Exposure.

Q4.b: CVA Calculation
   Calculated CVA (using path-dependent EPE): $187,309.43
   Total Net Cost of Derivative (Net Cost + CVA): $995,234.28
